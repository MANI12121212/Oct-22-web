### What is the command to write a commit message in Git?

Use:
```sh
git commit -a
```

 -a on the command line instructs git to commit the new content of all tracked files that have been modified. You can use 
```sh
git add <file>
```
or 
```sh
git add -A
```

before git commit -a if new files need to be committed for the first time.

<hr>

### What is difference between Git vs SVN?

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), whereas SVN is a centralised version control system. This is the fundamental difference between Git and SVN.

<hr>

### What do you understand by the term Version Control System?

Software technologies called version control systems assist software development teams in tracking changes to source code over time. Version control systems enable software teams to operate more swiftly and intelligently as development environments have increased.

<hr>

### What is Git?

Git is a Distributed Version Control system (DVCS). It can track changes to a file and allows you to revert back to any particular change.
It is a version control system that can efficiently manage small to very large projects and is free and open-source. Git is a tool used to log source code changes, allowing several engineers to collaborate on non-linear development.

The fact that it does not rely on a single server to store all the versions of a project's files is one of its distributed architecture's numerous advantages over other Version Control Systems (VCS) like SVN.

<hr>

### what is th difference between git and github?

Git is a version control tool that enables you to manage and monitor the history of your source code. Manage Git repositories using GitHub, a cloud-based hosting service. Git-based open-source projects can be managed more effectively using GitHub if you have any.

<hr>

### what-is-the-function-of-git-config
Git configuration values can be set at the global or project level with the git config command, which is a handy function. These settings are represented by text files with the extension. git-config. A configuration text file will be modified when git config is run.

<hr>

### What is Git fork? What is difference between fork, branch and clone?

* A **fork** is a remote, server-side copy of a repository, distinct from the original. A fork isn't a Git concept really, it's more a political/social idea. 
* A **clone** is not a fork; a clone is a local copy of some remote repository.  When you clone, you are actually copying the entire source repository, including all the history and branches.
* A **branch** is a mechanism to handle the changes within a single repository in order to eventually merge them with the rest of code. A branch is something that is within a repository. Conceptually, it represents a thread of development.

<hr>

### what-does-git-clone-do
A branch within a repository or a single repository can be copied using the git clone command. A distributed version control system is called Git. By cloning, you can take full advantage of a repository's benefits on your personal computer.

<hr> 

### What is the difference between "git pull" and "git fetch"?

In the simplest terms, `git pull` does a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge`.

* When you use `pull`, Git tries to automatically do your work for you. **It is context sensitive**, so Git will merge any pulled commits into the branch you are currently working in.  `pull` **automatically merges the commits without letting you review them first**. If you don‚Äôt closely manage your branches, you may run into frequent conflicts.

* When you `fetch`, Git gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in your current branch and **stores them in your local repository**. However, **it does not merge them with your current branch**. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on something that might break if you update your files. To integrate the commits into your master branch, you use `merge`.

<hr>

### What's the difference between a "pull request" and a "branch"?

* A **branch** is just a separate version of the code.

* A **pull request** is when someone take the repository, makes their own branch, does some changes, then tries to merge that branch in (put their changes in the other person's code repository).

<hr>

### How does the Centralized Workflow work?

The **Centralized Workflow** uses a central repository to serve as the single point-of for all changes to the project. The default development branch is called master and all changes are committed into this branch.

Developers start by cloning the central repository. In their own local copies of the project, they edit files and commit changes. These new commits are stored locally.

To publish changes to the official project, developers *push* their local master branch to the central repository. Before the developer can publish their feature, they need to *fetch* the updated central commits and rebase their changes on top of them. 

Compared to other workflows, the Centralized Workflow has no defined pull request or forking patterns. 

<hr>

### what-does-git-add-command-do
The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way‚Äîchanges are not actually recorded until you run git commit .

<hr>

### what-does-git-push-command-do?

The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.

# JavaScript Introduction

## What is JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.

## Why we need JavaScript

JavaScript makes web pages dynamic. Using JavaScript, it is also possible to load the content in a document without reloading the webpage.

## What JavaScript in browser can do

1. Can change existing HTML with new HTML using DOM(Object in JavaScript)
2. React to user actions/events.
3. Send requests to remote servers, download and upload files(AJAX).
4. Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
5. Remember the data on the client-side (‚Äúlocal storage‚Äù).

## What JavaScript cannot do in browser

1. JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access to OS functions.

2. Different tabs generally do not know about each other. Sometimes they do , 
for example when one tab uses JavaScript to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from one page may not access the other if they come from different sites.

This is called the ‚ÄúSame Origin Policy‚Äù. To work around that, both pages must agree for data exchange and contain a special JavaScript code that handles it.

## Why is JavaScript unique from other programming language

1. Full integration with HTML/CSS.
2. Simple things are done simply.
3. Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.


# Setup

I believe you have the motivation and a strong desire to be a developer, a computer and Internet. If you have those, then you have everything to get started.

## Install Node.js

You may not need Node.js right now but you may need it for later. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).


## Installing Mozilla FireFox

To install Firefox on your computer:

1. Visit this Firefox download page in any browser, such as Microsoft Edge.
2. Click the Download Now button. The Firefox Installer that downloads will automatically offer you the best available version of Firefox for your computer.

![FireFox download](images/Browser.png)

Click Open file in the Downloads notification on Microsoft Edge to start the process.
In other browsers, you may need to first save the Firefox installer to your computer, then open the file you downloaded.
**Note:** If you see an Open File - Security Warning dialog, click **Open** or **Run**.

![Open file](images/security.png)

3. The User Account Control dialog may open, to ask you to allow the Firefox Installer to make changes to your computer. If this dialog appears, click Yes to start the installation.

![User account control](images/control.png)

4. Wait for Firefox to finish installing.

![wait](images/wait.png)

5. When the installation is complete, Firefox will open.

![open](images/open.png)

**Congratulations, you are done installing Firefox!**

### Opening FireFox Console

You can open Google Chrome console either by clicking three lines at the top right corner of the browser, selecting _More tools -> web Developer tools_ or using a keyboard shortcut. I prefer using shortcuts.

![More tools](images/moretools.png)

![Dev Tools](images/devTools.png)

**ShortCut To open Browser Console**
```
For Windows
Ctrl+Shift+i
```

### Console.log

To write our first JavaScript code, we used a built-in function **console.log()**. We passed an argument as input data, and the function displays the output. We passed `'Hello, World'` as input data or argument in the console.log() function.
```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

### Console.log with Multiple Arguments

The **`console.log()`** function can take multiple parameters separated by commas. The syntax looks like as follows:**`console.log(param1, param2, param3)`**

![console](images/console.png)

```js
console.log('Hello', 'World', '!')
console.log('HAPPY', 'NEW', 'YEAR', 2020)
```

As you can see from the snippet code above, _`console.log()`_ can take multiple arguments.

Congratulations! You wrote your first JavaScript code using _`console.log()`_.


### Comments

We can add comments to our code. Comments are very important to make code more readable and to leave remarks in our code. JavaScript does not execute the comment part of our code. In JavaScript, any text line starting with // in JavaScript is a comment, and anything enclosed like this `//` is also a comment.

**Example: Single Line Comment**

```js
// This is the first comment  
// This is the second comment  
// I am a single line comment
```

**Example: Multiline Comment**

```js
/*
This is a multiline comment  
 Multiline comments can take multiple lines  
 JavaScript is the language of the web  
 */
```
